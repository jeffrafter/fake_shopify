## FAQ

**Q:** Can I make a real Shopify with this?<br>
**A:** No, don't be silly, this is just for faking.


## Fixtures

We don't want to recreate all of shopify. Shopify already did a great job of that. Instead we want to allow you to quickly replicate the behavior of Shopify from an API, theme, and app perspective. To do this we utilize fixtures. This project comes with a default set of fixtures for a sample store but you can download your own information and save them as fixtures as well.

## Themes

Shopify utilizes the liquid templating language for itâ€™s theme engine. We try to use the same engine and  provide the same features.

## Webhooks

Triggering webhooks

## Proxies

Registering your proxy
